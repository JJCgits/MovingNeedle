        <p align="Center"> PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) is a disorder, which like the name states, sometimes happens
            when you have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, or multiple traumatic events. Many people think that only war veterans
            or the elderly population that have survived wars can get PTSD, but this is not the case and there are many different ways that people could get PTSD.
