        <p align="Center"> Going through trauma is not very rare, around 6 out of every 10 men and 5 out of every 10 women experience trauma.
            And becuase going through trauma is the main cause of PTSD, 6 out of every 100 people (480,000,000) 
            suffer from PTSD at some point in their live. PTSD also has certain triggers (sounds, sights, smells, or thoughts) that 
            could make the patient feel as if they are living through the traumatic experience all over again. Triggers can be very 
            obvious, such as reading about a car crash but could also be very suttle such as a beach ball, if the patient was attacked on a beach.
            Everyone who experiences PTSD might experience it with different intensities and ways but there are many reacuring patterns that 
            that could be helpful to know when meeting someone with PTSD. This and the fact that PTSD is very common is why you should try your 
            best to learn more about PTSD. </p>
